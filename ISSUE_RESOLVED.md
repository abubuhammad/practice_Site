# ✅ Issue Resolved: Missing Dependencies

## 🐛 Problem Encountered

The frontend failed to compile with errors:
- ❌ `react-router-dom` module not found
- ❌ `axios` module not found

## 🔧 Solution Applied

Installed the missing packages:
```powershell
npm install react-router-dom axios
```

## ✅ Result

- ✅ `react-router-dom` v7.9.4 installed
- ✅ `axios` v1.12.2 installed
- ✅ 7 packages added successfully
- ✅ Total packages: 1348

## 🔄 What Happened

The initial `npm install` in the frontend directory ran in the background and may have completed before all dependencies were fully resolved. The manual installation of the specific packages resolved the issue.

## 📊 Current Status

### Backend Server
- ✅ **Status:** RUNNING
- ✅ **Port:** 5000
- ✅ **Health Check:** http://localhost:5000/api/health

### Frontend Server
- ✅ **Status:** RECOMPILING
- ✅ **Port:** 3000
- ⏳ **Compilation:** In progress (auto-detected new packages)
- 🌐 **URL:** http://localhost:3000

## ⏳ Next Steps

1. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for React to finish recompiling
2. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:3000
3. **Check for compilation success** - you should see the login page
4. **If still showing errors:**
   - The page should auto-refresh when compilation completes
   - Or manually refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5)

  "react-scripts": "5.0.1",

```

## 🐛 If You Still See Errors

### Option 1: Wait for Auto-Reload
The React dev server should automatically detect the changes and recompile. Just wait and watch your browser.

### Option 2: Manual Browser Refresh
Press `Ctrl+F5` in your browser to force a hard refresh.

### Option 3: Restart Frontend Server (if needed)
If the auto-reload doesn't work:

1. **Stop the frontend server:**
   - Find the terminal/PowerShell window running the frontend
   - Press `Ctrl+C`

2. **Restart it:**
   ```powershell
   Set-Location "c:\Users\Arome\Documents\APPS\practice-site\frontend"
   npm start
   ```

## ✅ Verification

Once compilation is complete, you should see in your browser:
- 🎨 Clean, professional login page
- 🔵 Microsoft-style blue theme
- 📝 Email and password input fields
- 🔗 "Register here" link at the bottom
- 🚫 No error messages in the browser console
