# ✅ History Page Fix Applied

## 🐛 Issue Found

**Error:**
```
attempts.filter is not a function
TypeError: attempts.filter is not a function
    at HistoryPage
```

**Root Cause:**
The HistoryPage was trying to call `.filter()` on `attempts`, but it wasn't an array because:
1. Frontend was accessing `response.data` instead of `response.data.attempts`
2. Backend was missing required fields (`exam_id`, `completed_at`, `time_taken`)

---

## 🔍 The Mismatch

### Frontend Expected:
```javascript
response.data.attempts = [
  {
    id: 1,
    exam_id: 1,
    exam_code: "AZ-900",
    exam_title: "...",
    score: 750,
    passing_score: 700,
    completed_at: "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
    time_taken: 3600  // seconds
  }
]
```

### Backend Was Returning:
```javascript
{
  attempts: [
    {
      id: 1,
      // ❌ Missing exam_id
      exam_code: "AZ-900",
      exam_title: "...",
      score: 750,
      passing_score: 700,
      start_time: "...",
      end_time: "...",
      // ❌ Missing completed_at
      // ❌ Missing time_taken
    }
  ]
}
```

## ✅ Solutions Applied

### Fix #1: Backend - Added Missing Fields
**Modified:** `backend/controllers/usersController.js`

1. ✅ Added `exam_id` to SQL query
2. ✅ Added `time_taken` calculation using `TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, start_time, end_time)`
3. ✅ Formatted response to include all required fields:
   - `id`
   - `exam_id`
   - `exam_code`
   - `exam_title`
   - `score`
   - `passing_score`
   - `passed` (boolean)
   - `completed_at` (mapped from `end_time`)
   - `time_taken` (in seconds)

### Fix #2: Frontend - Access Correct Property
**Modified:** `frontend/src/pages/HistoryPage.js`

1. ✅ Changed `setAttempts(response.data)` to `setAttempts(response.data.attempts || [])`
2. ✅ Added fallback to empty array on error: `setAttempts([])`
