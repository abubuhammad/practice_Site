## 🚀 Next Steps: Installation & Testing

### Step 1: Install Backend Dependencies
```powershell
Set-Location "c:\Users\Arome\Documents\APPS\practice-site\backend"
npm install
```

**Required packages:**
- express
- mysql2
- bcryptjs
- jsonwebtoken
- dotenv
- cors
- multer

### Step 2: Install Frontend Dependencies
```powershell
Set-Location "c:\Users\Arome\Documents\APPS\practice-site\frontend"
npm install
```

**Required packages:**
- react
- react-dom
- react-router-dom
- axios

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create `backend/.env` file:
```env
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=exam_practice_db
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_change_this_in_production
```

### Step 4: Initialize Database
```powershell
# Make sure MySQL is running
Set-Location "c:\Users\Arome\Documents\APPS\practice-site"
node backend/scripts/initDatabase.js
```

This will create:
- 7 tables (users, exams, questions, options, case_studies, attempts, attempt_answers)
- All relationships and foreign keys
- Indexes for performance

### Step 5: Seed Database
```powershell
node backend/scripts/seedDatabase.js
```

This will add:
- 3 Microsoft certification exams (AZ-900, AZ-104, DP-900)
- 23 practice questions with explanations
- 2 case study scenarios
- Demo admin account: admin@example.com / admin123
- Demo user account: user@example.com / user123

### Step 6: Start Backend Server
```powershell
Set-Location "c:\Users\Arome\Documents\APPS\practice-site\backend"
node server.js
```

Expected output:
```
Server running on port 5000
Database connected successfully
```

### Step 7: Start Frontend Development Server
```powershell
# Open a new terminal
Set-Location "c:\Users\Arome\Documents\APPS\practice-site\frontend"
npm start
```

The app should open at: http://localhost:3000
