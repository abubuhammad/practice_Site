# ✅ API Route Fixes Applied

## 🐛 Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: User Stats and Attempts Routes Mismatch
**Problem:**
- Frontend was calling: `/api/users/${userId}/stats` and `/api/users/${userId}/attempts`
- Backend only had: `/api/users/me/stats` and `/api/users/me/attempts`
- Result: 404 errors on Dashboard and History pages

**Solution:**
✅ Updated `frontend/src/services/api.js`:
- Changed `usersAPI.getUserStats(userId)` → `usersAPI.getUserStats()`
- Changed `usersAPI.getUserAttempts(userId)` → `usersAPI.getUserAttempts()`
- Both now call `/users/me/stats` and `/users/me/attempts`

✅ Updated `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.js`:
- Removed userId parameter from API calls
- Now uses authenticated user from token

✅ Added `attemptsAPI.getUserAttempts()` for History page

---

### Issue 2: Start Exam HTTP Method Mismatch
**Problem:**
- Frontend was using: `POST /api/exams/${examId}/start`
- Backend expected: `GET /api/exams/${examId}/start`
- Result: 404 error when starting exam

**Solution:**
✅ Updated `frontend/src/services/api.js`:
- Changed `examsAPI.startExam()` from POST to GET

---

### Issue 3: Start Exam Response Format Mismatch
**Problem:**
- Frontend expected: `response.data.attempt.id`
- Backend returned: `response.data.attempt_id`

**Solution:**
✅ Updated `backend/controllers/examsController.js`:
- Changed response format to match frontend expectations:
```javascript
{
  attempt: {
    id: attemptId,
    time_limit_minutes: exam.time_limit_minutes
  },
  questions
}
```

### Issue 4: Missing Get Exam Questions Endpoint
**Problem:**
- Frontend was calling: `GET /api/exams/${examId}/questions?attempt_id=${attemptId}`
- Backend had no such route
- Result: ExamInterfacePage couldn't load questions

**Solution:**
✅ Added new route in `backend/routes/exams.js`:
```javascript
router.get('/:examId/questions', authenticateToken, examsController.getExamQuestions);
```

✅ Added new controller function in `backend/controllers/examsController.js`:
- `getExamQuestions()` - Returns questions for an existing attempt
- Verifies attempt belongs to authenticated user
- Returns questions without revealing correct answers
