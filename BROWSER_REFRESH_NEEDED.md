# üîÑ Browser Cache Issue - Hard Refresh Required

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue

The frontend code has been updated with all the API fixes, but your browser is still using the **old cached JavaScript files**. This is why you're still seeing 404 errors.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Hard Refresh Your Browser

You need to perform a **hard refresh** to force the browser to download the new JavaScript files.

### Windows (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
Press: **Ctrl + Shift + R**

OR

Press: **Ctrl + F5**

### Alternative Method (Any Browser)
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button in the browser toolbar
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## üß™ After Hard Refresh, Test These:

### 1. Dashboard Page (http://localhost:3000)
- Should load without 404 errors in console
- Should show your statistics
- Should show recent attempts
- Should show available exams

### 2. Start an Exam
- Click on any exam (e.g., AZ-900)
- Click "Start Exam"
- Should navigate to exam interface
- Questions should load

### 3. Check Browser Console
- Press F12 to open Developer Tools
- Go to Console tab
- Should see NO 404 errors
- Should see successful API calls

## üîç How to Verify the Fix Worked

After hard refresh, check the Network tab in Developer Tools:

1. Press F12
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for these API calls:
   - ‚úÖ `GET /api/users/me/stats` (should return 200)
   - ‚úÖ `GET /api/users/me/attempts` (should return 200)
   - ‚úÖ `GET /api/exams` (should return 200)

**OLD (WRONG) calls should NOT appear:**
- ‚ùå `GET /api/users/1/stats` (should NOT be called)
- ‚ùå `GET /api/users/2/stats` (should NOT be called)
- ‚ùå `POST /api/exams/2/start` (should NOT be POST)

## üöÄ If Hard Refresh Doesn't Work

Try these additional steps:

### Option 1: Clear Browser Cache Completely
1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Refresh the page

### Option 2: Restart Frontend Server
```powershell
# Kill all node processes
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force

# Restart frontend
Set-Location "c:\Users\Arome\Documents\APPS\practice-site\frontend"; npm start
```

### Option 3: Use Incognito/Private Window
- Open a new incognito/private window
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000
