# ✅ Results Page Fix Applied

## 🐛 Issue Found

**Error:**
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')
    at ResultsPage
```

**Root Cause:**
The backend and frontend had a **data format mismatch** for the attempt details endpoint.

---

## 🔍 The Mismatch

### Frontend Expected (ResultsPage.js):
```javascript
{
  attempt: { ... },
  results: [
    {
      question_text: "...",
      is_correct: true/false,
      selected_options: ["Option text 1", "Option text 2"],  // Array of text
      correct_options: ["Correct option text"],              // Array of text
      explanation: "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Backend Was Returning:
```javascript
{
  attempt: { ... },
  answers: [  // ❌ Wrong property name
    {
      question_text: "...",
      is_correct: true/false,
      selected_option_ids: [1, 2],  // ❌ IDs instead of text
      correct_option_ids: [3],      // ❌ IDs instead of text
      explanation: "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Modified: `backend/controllers/attemptsController.js`

**Changed the `getAttemptDetails` function to:**

1. ✅ Return `results` instead of `answers`
2. ✅ Convert option IDs to option text:
   - `selected_options`: Array of selected option texts
   - `correct_options`: Array of correct option texts
3. ✅ Include all required fields:
   - `question_id`
   - `question_text`
   - `question_type`
   - `is_correct`
   - `marked_for_review`
   - `explanation`
   - `selected_options` (text array)
   - `correct_options` (text array)
   - `selected_option_ids` (ID array for reference)
   - `correct_option_ids` (ID array for reference)
4. ✅ Added missing fields to attempt object:
   - `exam_id`
   - `passing_score`
